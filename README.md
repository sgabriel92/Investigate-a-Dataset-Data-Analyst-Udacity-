Investigate a TMDb movie database through Data Wrangling Exploratory Data Analysis

# Introduction
Conducted data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. 
Use of pandas and NumPy to answer questions that were raised and I was interested in, and created a report for sharing the answers. 

# Dataset
In this report I analyze data from the TMDb movie data base provided by Kaggle. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

Analyized the dataset and answered the questions I raised 
Performed Data Wrangling as needed.
